# **Blog Title**: Release WK21-22

Hi allðŸ‘‹,

As always it's an absolute pleasure to inform you what our team has been working on to make your experience at PitchPrint even better.

What's newðŸš€,

Parallel file upload limit increase - In the past, our file upload limit per cycle was set to 12 and our customers could only upload the
aforementioned number of files at a time and having to wait for the next cycle in order to upload more files. The initial restriction was
put in place so as to avoid slowing down the system. However, we found a middle ground and increased the file upload limit to now 20 which
allows for much more uploads at a time but without overwhelming the system.

Archive orders on WIX - We have added this amazing feature on the #WIX platform which allows the admin to archive their orders using a
toggle switch. It will assist with decluttering the orders page for admins especially when handling sizeable volume orders and best of all
the orders can be accessed at anytime by simply using the toggle switch to view archived orders.

Add shopId to project details - We've also added the shopId to projects feature on #Prestashop platform for our customers who were unable to
identify easily which project belonged where especially for those with multiple stores. This great feature will now show the unique shopId
of the store inside the project page next to each project to ensure the store owner will know exactly which shop the project belongs to.

Wordpress Update - Lastly, we made an update to Wordpress where we've improved the display of metadata.

We also fixed the following bugs:

Template Color Module inside edited project - We had an issue whereby when a customer edited a project using the template color module, the
module would no longer be available inside the project once the project was opened. We have fixed this issue and the module will now be
available when the customer edits a project.

Well that's it for this week folks but please do check our new Tutorial Videos on the admin panel by opening the following tab
https://admin.pitchprint.com/videos [https://admin.pitchprint.com/videos]. We've added quite a few how to videos to assist all of our
valuable customers on how to manoeuvre around our platform, covering all the from settings to creating designs and easily watch at your
convenience. We'll add more videos in the weeks to come covering topics such as Modules etc. with practical examples, so please keep an eye
out!

Have a lovely and productive week from the PitchPrint Team!ðŸ˜Š
