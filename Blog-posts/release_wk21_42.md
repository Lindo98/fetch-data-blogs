Hi allðŸ‘‹,

It's good to be back! We've been busy with so much and we can't wait to share it with you.

What's newðŸš€,

API for Product Images - In the past our WooCommerce customers had to manually upload a product page image for each product. We looked into
this problem and made an update to our client.js file to be able to detect if a product page image is present or not, and if no image is
available, then the PitchPrint design will be added as the default product image.

We were prioritising more bug fixes this week. Here is a list of our fixes:

Image Search Panel - Some of our clients experienced an issue with the search panel inside images. When a customer utilised the search bar
and then cleared the search text, the image category would remain the same and wouldn't give the customer the ability to switch to a
different category thereafter. We have fixed this issue and customers can now clear the search bar and manoeuvre between categories without
experiencing any glitches.

Rotated Text Issue - Our customers experienced an issue of a text moving off canvas when editing a rotated text. We have fixed this issue
and the text will now remain fixed in one place irrespective whether there are any edits made to the text or not.

Layout Caching issue - When an admin made changes to the layout, the changes wouldn't rollout to the front end and still displayed the
previous layout due to cache. We've fixed this issue by adding a random number to the URL of each layout and should now load the update
instantly.

That's it for this week folks but before you go, we are still keen on receiving your valuable feedback and just to sweeten the deal we are
