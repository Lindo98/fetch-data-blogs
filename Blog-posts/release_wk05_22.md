Hi allðŸ‘‹,

As always it's a pleasure for us to keep you up to date with what our team has been working on to make your experience at PitchPrint an even
better one.

What's newðŸš€,

Customize button on Product Category - In the past the end user had to open a product page to be able to use PitchPrint to customise your
products. We've now added this great feature on Wordpress that allows you to enable the customisation button to be displayed on the category
page without having to navigate to the product page. Please have a look at the images below for reference:

To enable this feature please make sure that category customisation is enabled, please see below for reference:

Now onto our weekly bug fixes:

Drag and drop issue with text art - We had an issue where text arts could not be dragged and dropped onto the canvas, you could only click
on a text art to add it to the canvas. We've fixed this issue and text arts can now be conveniently dragged and dropped as well as clicked
to be added to the canvas.

We're in the process of updating our 3D Studio Library to make our models even more realistic refining them into something you can almost
feel and touch. We've added quite a number of new models to offer more variety for you to choose from. Please go to
https://admin.pitchprint.com/three [https://admin.pitchprint.com/three] and click add new model to see our collection of 3D models. Here are
some of the models we recently added below:
