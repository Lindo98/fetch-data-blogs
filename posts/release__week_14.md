# **Blog Title**: Release #WEEK 14

 * Upload issue on Phones - Fixed issue after uploading an image on mobile, the upload tab would close and the canvas would display.
 * Added Shopify Order Complete Webhook - We've added the order-completed webhook to Shopify.
 * Modified navigation thumbnail label - We've modified the thumbnail label so that when text is too long, the text extends instead of
   cutting off; we also moved the label to the top of the thumbnail.

 * User data now appears for Shopify - When a user is logged into your store, their data is available and synced to designs. We added this
   to Shopify stores.
 * Gallery Search feature - We've implemented the gallery search feature in v10 so customers can search for images using keywords in
   background and picture panels. The keywords used are provided by admin in the Pictures [https://admin.pitchprint.io/pictures] and
   Background [https://admin.pitchprint.io/backgrounds] sections.
 * Titles for Module tabs - We've added titles for all module tabs.
 * Text formatting issue - Fixed an issue with text elements where some parts get formatted while others remain numb when editing is
   disabled.
 * We still do daily releases and many other small bugs were fixed along the week.
