Hi allðŸ‘‹,

We trust that you are well and had a relaxing weekend and keeping safe during these trying timesðŸ™‚.

Last week we worked on the following:

Context menu buttons on mobile - When cropping an image on mobile, the context menu buttons weren't present. We fixed this issue. Please
re-save your styling [https://admin.pitchprint.com/styling] for this to work.

Display thumbnail in form - The upload image indicator was not present inside the data form module or inside the form until after a customer
uploaded an image. We added a default image upload indicator.

Search by Date - We added the ability to search by date using a calendar in the universal search console on our new Admin Panel
[https://admin.pitchprint.com/dashboard].


NEW DESIGN SELECTIONS

Additionally we've updated our import design library, we now have 28 categories to choose from and plenty of new designs added to existing

rdpress Update - Lastly, we made an update to Wordpress where we've improved the display of metadata.

We also fixed the following bugs:

Template Color Module inside edited project - We had an issue whereby when a customer edited a project using the template color module, the
module would no longer be available inside the project once the project was opened. We have fixed this issue and the module will now be
available when the customer edits a project.
