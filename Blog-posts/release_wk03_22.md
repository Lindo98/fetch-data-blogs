# **Blog Title**: Release WK03-22

Hi allðŸ‘‹,

A warm welcome from our team to you and we would like to kick off our first post by thanking you for your continued valuable support and
hopefully 2022 will be great for all of us! ðŸ˜Š

We are absolutely thrilled to let you know what we've been working on since resume back to the office to make your experience at PitchPrint
an even better one.

What's newðŸš€,

Disable Zoom on Mobile - We added a toggle switch for you to enable and disable zoom on mobile, you can find this switch in settings
[https://admin.pitchprint.com/settings].

Product Image API - We added some code on Wordpress to check if there's a product image, if no product image is provided it will use the
PitchPrint design as the default product image. You can enable this feature in Wordpress admin when assigning a design to a product. Please
have a look below:

Now moving into our weekly bug fixes:

Adjusting Opacity - We had an issue with adjusting opacity when a customer made the adjustment inside the designer, as a result the PDF
would render incorrect colors. We have now fixed this issue and you will receive the correct color in the PDF when opacity has been applied.

Draw on canvas - We also had a minor issue with draw on canvas when customers click to preview their drawings and subsequently close the
preview window, the issue would arise thereafter when a customer tries to exit the draw on canvas mode. We have fixed this issue as well and
draw on canvas mode is now automatically exited when you click on preview.

Customize button on iPhone - We had an issue where the customize button was not showing on iPhone in Shopify. We made a minor update on our
end the the customize button is now showing.
