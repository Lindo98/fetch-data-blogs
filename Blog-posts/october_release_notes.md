> Release Notes will be our monthly report that highlights recent product improvements we‚Äôve made so you can easily stay up to date on
> what‚Äôs new with PitchPrint.


STICKY CONTEXT MENU

Yes, your context menu can now be hooked to the top part of the designer. It will slide to appear and slide back to hide. You can enable
this in your admin settings page [https://admin.pitchprint.io/settings] by disabling the Float Context Menu option. But first, you need to
Reload the latest layout [https://admin.pitchprint.io/layouts].

TRANSFORM CONTROLS

The new Transform controls allow users to easily rotate and skew objects on the canvas using simple numeric sliders. We have a much fuller
control coming for mobile UI. This feature also requires you to load the latest layout.

TEXT WRAP

This is a feature available in version 8. It's a TextBox feature that basically wraps a text to the next line as against auto stretching the
text line.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


MINI DISPLAY MODE

We have had Modal and Inline display modes; the Mini mode shows a basic, stripped down version of the editor, letting the user quickly "fill
out a form" to personalize their designs. It's for quick, simple products where speed-to-add-to-cart is of utmost importance. It supports
both text and file uploads.

WEBHOOKS

Our Webhook enables you to notify a service or trigger an event whenever an event happens on PitchPrint relating to your store. For
instance, you may want to send the PDF file of a project directly to your printer, or save all your user's uploaded pictures in your DropBox
or Google Drive.

We do have a detailed example enumerating how to integrate with platforms like Zapier. You can read more here:
