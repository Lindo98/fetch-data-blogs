 * Mask Image Depth - We've fixed an issue whereby a mask whose image is deleted looses depth and forcefully appears in the front.
 * Customized File for 3D Cart - The final PDF file is now available in the order details in 3D Cart.
 * No Constraints - Fixed issue. No constraints setting for a clickable mask has been fixed in v10.
 * Bleed Fill - We've added a new feature in settings, which allows you to fill the bleed area with a lighter transparent value of the bleed
   line color. We are looking at adding hash lines over this as well, so it doesn't look as though it's a part of the design.

 * Skip Preview - We've added the skip preview feature to v10. Customers can finish their designs without the preview step.
 * Copy and paste text from 3rd party source - We've added a feature to give the user the ability to copy and paste new text from outside
   sources using Ctrl/Cmd + V
