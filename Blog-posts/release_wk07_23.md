Hi allðŸ‘‹,

We're back and hope that you're having an awesome new year thus far. We appreciate your support over the past year and we look forward to a
much more exciting year ahead.

As always it's an absolute pleasure for us to keep you up to date with what our team has been working on to make your experience on
PitchPrint the best possible.

What's newðŸš€,

Order completed Webhook BigCommerce - Our webhooks allow Admins to automate processes like sending files (uploaded files OR customized
design files) to an endpoint provided once a certain action is completed. We currently offer the following webhooks:

File Upload - When a file is uploaded inside the editor.

Project Saved - When a customer submits their design inside an editor.

Order Processing - While the order is processing.

Order Completed - When an order is completed.

On the initial #BigCommerce release, we were only able to offer our customers File Upload and Project Saved webhook events. We are excited
to announce that we have now added the Order Completed webhook which should allow Admins to send order detail information, PDF/ PNG/ JPEG
files and so much more.

Item Dimension Display - Previously, it was a challenge for customers to gage the dimensions of an item added on the canvas more especially
if that item was being modified. We have now added this amazing new feature which displays the items dimensions while it is being resized on
the canvas.

We also fixed the following bug fixes:

Resume Design and Save for later WIX - Some of our customers had an issue with resuming a work in progress design on WIX from their
respective account page in order to modify it. We have gone ahead and fixed this issue, our #Wix customers should now be able to relaunch
and edit an incomplete design without any hassles.

We also had an issue with the Save For Later functionality on WIX whereby once a customer clicks on the save for later button, the
respective saved designs would unfortunately not display under the orders tab. This issue is now a thing of the past Â and our customer
should now be able to see all past orders as well as incomplete designs.

That's it for this week but before you go, would you like to earn a $10 voucher absolutely free that you can spend anywhere? Well we're
still running a campaign in conjunction with Capterra whereby a $10 voucher will given to the first 30 people to review us on the Capterra
