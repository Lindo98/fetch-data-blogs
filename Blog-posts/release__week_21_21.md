# **Blog Title**: Release #WEEK 21-21

Hi allðŸ‘‹

What's newðŸš€

We added a feature that allows customers to choose their image source directly when clicking on a mask. When you click on a mask instead of
taking you to your image gallery it will now open a panel so you can select your image source.

This will require you to reload your Layout [https://admin.pitchprint.com/layouts] to the latest as well as re-save your Styling

Last week we fixed the following issues:

Applied filter to images in the PDF - When a PDF was downloaded inside the application in the front end, the filters were not being applied
to affected images inside the design. We fixed it so that, the filters are now applied to images inside the design.

Pixabay CORS requests - A few days back, Pixabay updated their API removing certain headers which affected CORS requests, thus many
customers experienced issues with adding Pixabay images because the images could not be fetched from the source. We did fix this.

Thumbnail image selection in Admin - Thumbnail images selected in design configuration in admin did not replace the design thumbnails on the
product page. We fixed the issue so admins can now upload their own thumbnail image they want to display when design selector is enabled.

That's it for now, we'll be back next week with more exciting features and bug fixes.
