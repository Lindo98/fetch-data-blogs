 * Input Mask (beta) - We are adding input mask capability for Text items. In the current state, it only works with Data Form Module and the
   Customize Form. Basically, an input mask is used in formatting text inputs to a particular format.
   Think of asking users to provide their phone number in a particular format, an email, ZIP Code etc. You can find an example here:

 * DPI Calculations - We did improve the DPI calculations to cater for zoom

 * QR Codes - Version 10 now has the QR Code module

 * Lock Page Warning - We added a warning when admin locks a page. We usually recieve a lot of queries that users could not edit or add
   items to pages. This happens when the admin has locked the page.
