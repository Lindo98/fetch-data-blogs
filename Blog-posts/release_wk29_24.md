Hi all ðŸ‘‹,

It's been a while but I can assure you we're working hard as always to make your experience on PitchPrint an even better one.

What's new ðŸš€,

Photo Print Module data in PDF Bookmarks - A while ago we released a feature which adds the data of the Photo Module to the PDF you can read
more about it here [https://blog.pitchprint.com/wk44/]. When we released this feature we only had two PDF distillers at that point in time.
We have however added a third PDF distiller since then. We are pleased to announce that we have now added this amazing feature to PDF
distiller version 3. This functionality allows the admin to see all the data regarding the Photo Print Module within the bookmark of the
PDF.

Design Observables on WIX - Â We're working hard at making sure that all of our platforms are equal with regards to functionality, so without
further a do. We added the Design Observables module to the WIX platform this amazing category module now works on all WIX stores. Please
read more about design observables on the following link [https://docs.pitchprint.com/article/136-design-observables].

Partial search on Shopify - In the past the Shopify Products search was only limited to exact product search. However this was cumbersome
for our customer's since it would only pull up a product if you used the exact name of that product. We implemented the partial search which
allows you to search for a product using one or more keywords which the name contains.

AI Image Outpaint and Smart Replace - We updated the AI Image tool with two new features Outpaint and Smart Replace. Outpaint service
inserts additional content in an image, basically expands the image. Smart replace allows users to leverage a search_prompt to identify an
object to be replaced in an image. The service will automatically segment the object and replace it with the object requested in the prompt.

Exciting new 3D scenes - We know our 3D models are loved but it doesn't stop there for us we've been creating entire scenes to not only
allow end users to preview products, but also to view and change different products within an environment. Please have a look at a few of
our scenes below:
