explanation for each module

We also fixed the following bugs:

Text tab could not be selected as default tab - By default, we provide the option for an Admin to select a default tab that will be shown
for each design when it loads in the designer.

We had an issue with the text tab when a user selected it as the default tab. It would not load as the default but instead the background
tab would be displayed. We have fixed this issue and the tab will now be displayed correctly as the default option. Please have a look at
the image below for reference:
