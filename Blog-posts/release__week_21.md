# **Blog Title**: Release #WEEK 21

[https://blog.pitchprint.com/wk21](https://blog.pitchprint.com/wk21)

 * Mobile Experience - Over the past two weeks, we tweaked the mobile interface to be more responsive and fixed the nagging issue of the tab
   hiding when the UI is being scrolled. The text editor is appropriately positioned. We plan on doing more work on the interface here.
 * Photo Crop - We have fixed some issues with the photo crop module including a solid undo state management to revert to previous crop
   states. The issue with black canvas after an image has been deleted is also fixed.
 * Curved Text - We fixed the issue whereby curved text's fonts could not be changed.
 * Image Filter issues - Large images with filters gets cropped. This was due to the texture size used in the filter and has been fixed.
 * Font Size Slider - When a user clicks to show the font slider, it now defaults to showing 4x the current font size as maximum value with
   a minimum value of 2 points. So if the current font size is 12, the slider range will be 2 - 48. For a 30 font size, the range will be 2
   - 120. This way, it adapts to the selected font size.
 * Text Transform - A button has been added to More text options drop down to toggle text case from lower case to all caps and vice versa.
 * Minor updates - Added an Ok button to welcome message; Certain fonts not loading on Mobile; and lots more minor fixes and improvements.
