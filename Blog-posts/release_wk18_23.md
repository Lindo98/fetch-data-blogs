Hi everyoneðŸ‘‹,

We are delighted to share with you the latest updates from our team at PitchPrint, which are aimed at improving your overall experience.

What's newðŸš€,

Preview Pages of a design on Wordpress - One of the new features we have introduced is the ability for admins to preview multiple pages of a
design on Wordpress. Previously, only the first page of a design was visible in the order details on Wordpress admin. However, with this new
functionality, admins can now view up to 10 pages of a design simply by clicking on the preview image in the order details. Please refer to
the images below for more information:

Attach order ID to project on Wordpress - We have made another improvement to PitchPrint by adding the Wordpress order ID to the project
details. This will help users to easily identify which project belongs to which order. The order ID will be visible alongside the project
ID.

We also fixed the following issue: Â 

Scroll in left panel - A customer reported that the scroll bar would sometimes disappear when zooming in too far inside the editor. This
issue arose because the left section height was set to 100%, but only a portion of images were being displayed in the section. As a result,
the browser assumed that the scroll bar was unnecessary because all the available space in the section was already in use. We have resolved
this issue and the scroll bar will now appear regardless of the zoom value. Please see the images below for a visual representation:

so the customer can scroll down to see the rest of the images.

And that's it for this week, folks! We hope you have a productive week ahead from the PitchPrint team.ðŸ˜Š
