Hi allðŸ‘‹,

It's always an absolute pleasure for us to keep you up to date with what our team has been working on to make your experience at PitchPrint
the best there is.

What's newðŸš€,

Progress bar for image upload - Previously, when the end user uploaded their images, they wouldn't know the progress of the image being
uploaded on the product page particularly when a store uses a Mini Display Mode. Weâ€™ve now added this cool new feature which displays a
progress bar on every product that uses this specific (mini) display mode when an image is uploaded. This way the customer will always be
able to see the status of the images uploaded at any given moment.

Endpoint to convert a Project into a Design - In the past, if an admin user wanted to convert a project to a design, they would have to
recreate the project as a design from scratch which is counterintuitive to one of the things we are known for, being a Fast web2print
plugin. We've corrected this wrong with this amazing new feature which uses an endpoint that allows the admin to convert a project into a
design instantly. Please have a look at the endpoint below:

> https://api.pitchprint.com/runtime/project-to-design [https://api.pitchprint.com/runtime/project-to-design]

Kindly use your Secret key as an Authorization in the header, your secret key can be found here [https://admin.pitchprint.com/domains], and
subsequently parse the categoryId and the projectId as JSON data in the body.

> Please do not hesitate to reach out to support should you need any assistance.

Keyboard Shortcuts - We've added a few new cool keyboard shortcuts as well as existing keyboard shortcuts that most users are not aware of,
you can have a quick look at the list of keyboard shortcuts below:

Hold down space key - This will allow you to pan and move the canvas around with your mouse or trackpad.
Ctrl + C - Copy
Ctrl + V - Paste
Ctrl + A - Select All Items
Ctrl + X - Cut
Ctrl + W - Close
Keyboard shortcuts for Undo and Redo (This will differ per Operating system)
Left and Right arrows - Can be used to navigate between all pages of a design in the preview window. Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Ctrl + Arrows - Â To move in
increments of 5 or more steps.

We will be adding more keyboard shortcuts as we go along.

That's it for this week but please do check our PitchPrint Community Forum [https://www.facebook.com/groups/267392805495926/] where we are
