Hi allðŸ‘‹,

It's always an absolute pleasure for us to keep you up to date with what our team has been working on to make your experience on PitchPrint
even better.

What's newðŸš€,

Single or Double Sided Module - We've added an amazing new #Module called Single/Double Sided to our expansive list of modules
[https://docs.pitchprint.com/category/22-using-modules]. This amazing feature will give your customers the ability to choose whether they
would like to have either a single design or double sided design inside the editor. Now if a customer chooses a single design option, the
editor will open up with only one page and if they choose double then the editor will open up with two pages respectively. This feature uses
a variation element selector which will assist us to determine the number of pages the customer opted for whilst designing. To view a demo
of this amazing new feature then quickly go to https://wp.demo.pitchprint.io/product/palette-business-card/
[https://wp.demo.pitchprint.io/product/palette-business-card/].

DesignId in URL on Wordpress - We have also added this awesome new feature which will assist the admin user in setting the designId of a
product directly in the URL. You can achieve this result by adding a filter in your functions.php file of your theme. Please see image below

uploads either a file that is too large or if it's an unsupported file type.
