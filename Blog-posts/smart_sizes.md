# **Blog Title**: Smart Sizes

Hi guysðŸ‘‹

We have an exciting new feature we've been working on that we can't wait to share with you.

It's called Smart Sizes. Basically it's a feature that allows a designer to create multiple variations of a single design by varying the
canvas size and elements' properties to come up with entirely different looking layouts.

So, imagine you have a card product in three sizes: Landscape, Portrait and Square. In the past you would have to create these as three
separate designs and find ways to wire them to a single product.

Well, using this feature, you start by creating the first size, placing every element nicely to your taste.

Next, you simply enable the Smart Sizes on that page and click the plus sign to add a new size:

By design, the next size is a swap of the Width and Height but you can always adjust the values in the page configuration as you would
resize a page.

After adding a new size, it's necessary to reposition or resize the elements to fit well with the new size.

And you can add a third or forth size as you wish.

When adding new elements to the canvas they need to be positioned in both instances, for it to display correctly.

To enable Smart Canvas go to your designs [https://admin.pitchprint.com/designs] page in the admin, open the design where you would like to
enable Smart Canvas. You should see the below option on your left enable it and start by adding a new smart page by clicking the plus iconâŠ•
