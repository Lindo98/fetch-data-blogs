Hi allðŸ‘‹,

It's always an absolute pleasure for us to inform you what our team has been working on to make your experience at PitchPrint an even better
one.

What's new ðŸš€,

CategoryId in Bulk Configuration - In the past our customers had to use the PHP code fetch-design-categories from our documentation in order
to get the CategoryId. We've now introduced another option of adding the CategoryId to the bulk configuration section in order to save you
the time and effort of running PHP code whenever you need to get the categoryId also adding more variety for your convenience. Please have a
quick look below:

Minimum Font Size - We've also added a Minimum Font Size option in the design configuration settings. Now with this exciting new feature,
you can set the minimum font for a design and the font will not be able to go below this value. Kindly refer to the screenshot below:

Now onto our weekly bug fixes:

Roll up banner designs - We had an issue with importing designs from the roll up banner category. When these designs were imported and
launched in the editor the background wouldn't display. We have gone ahead and fixed this issue and the design will now display correctly as
shown in the thumbnail.

Preview button in import designs section - We had a minor glitch with the preview button in the import designs section. We've fixed this
issue as well and you can now preview designs before importing them. Have a look at the below screenshot for reference:
