Wordpress cart image update - A few weeks ago we made an update to Wordpress that would allow an admin to hide the preview in the cart if
Retain Page Images was enabled on PitchPrint Admin please refer to the image below for reference:

[https://blog.pitchprint.com/content/images/2022/11/image-6.png]This setting will keep product page images and not use the customers design.

This update unfortunately was not updated accordingly by the carting platform across all our Wordpress users. In some instances where an
admin enabled this feature, the image would update and replace the Product Page image with the user design and subsequently the cart image
as well instead of hiding the preview. Upon further investigation, we noted that the store theme for some of our customers also played a
part in the update not being deployed successfully across all Wordpress users. We recently made another update which will address this issue
for all our WordPress users irrespective of their store theme.

This issue has been fixed and if an admin enables this feature it will now be applied correctly and the product image will not update but
will be saved/archived accordingly.

That's it for this week but before you go, would you like to earn a $10 voucher absolutely free that you can spend anywhere? Well we're
running a campaign in conjunction with Capterra whereby a $10 voucher will given to the first 30 people to review us on the Capterra
