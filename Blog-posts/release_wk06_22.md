# **Blog Title**: Release WK06-22

Hi allðŸ‘‹,

As always we're excited to keep you up to date with what our team has been working on to make your experience on PitchPrint even better.

What's newðŸš€,

Category Customisation in Prestashop - In the past, the customer had to open each product individually to be able to use the editor which
was not the most efficient way of finalising a design/order for the end user. We've now added a button to this product section which will
allow the customer to access the editor directly from the product category page. Please have a look at the images below for reference:

To enable this feature please go to your Prestashop admin panel where you will be able to configure PitchPrint and click on the checkbox as
indicated below:

Non-reactive canvas on Mobile - We've also added a new feature that will make the canvas non-reactive in mini mode on mobile display.
Previously, the screen used to be reactive and subsequently caused issues with customers zooming in or mistakenly selecting other elements
on the canvas that would affect the customer using the editor and customising their designs. The canvas will now remain static while the
customer uses the editor on mobile in mini mode display.

Now onto our weekly bug fixes:

Show draw on canvas at the top - We had an issue with draw on canvas and elements that were set to always-top. The issue was that the shape
drawn would not be displayed whilst in process yet the element on top would display throughout, so the user couldn't actually see the shape
that they were drawing until the drawing was completed. We've fixed this issue and the shape will now be displayed while the customer is
drawing and will subsequently be moved to the back after the drawing is completed.

That's it for this week but please do check our PitchPrint Community Forum [https://www.facebook.com/groups/267392805495926/] where we are
running a teaching series on our amazing product features, unearthing some of our product hidden gems etc. so that our customers get the
best value for their subscription.

Stay glued to our blog for some more exciting news about new features and bug fixes. Have a lovely week from the PitchPrint Team ðŸ˜Š
