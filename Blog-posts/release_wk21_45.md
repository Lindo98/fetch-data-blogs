Hi allðŸ‘‹,

As always, it's an absolute pleasure for our team to keep you up to date about what we've been working on to make your experience at
PitchPrint an even better one.

What's newðŸš€,

Runtime API Clone Project - We have finally added the Runtime API Clone Project, developers and admin users can now use this API to
duplicate/clone projects. Do read up here [https://docs.pitchprint.com/article/126-clone-project] for more information about this amazing
API.

Now onto our weekly bug fixes:

Grey border in PNG and JPEG files - Our canvas has a grey border on the edges which aids in indicating to the user where the canvas ends.
The grey border is more pronounced when the canvas is blank. Previously, the border would appear on JPEG or PNG files of downloaded designs
or projects. We have now removed the border on the downloaded design and project files but it will still reflect on the canvas so as to
serve as a guide for users.

Foreground Image issue - Some of our customers experienced an issue whereby a foreground image would exceed the canvas size. This is now a
thing of the past and the foreground image fits perfectly on the canvas.

Canvas Lines in Smart Sizes - We also had a minor issue where the canvas lines did not change when updating each page of the Smart Sizes
module. The canvas lines would remain the same across all dimensions and pages irrespective of the modifications applied. We have gone ahead
and fixed this issue and admin users can now update the canvas lines uniquely per page.
