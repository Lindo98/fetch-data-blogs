Hi allðŸ‘‹,

It's been a minute, and as always it's an absolute pleasure for us to keep you updated with what our team has been working on to make your
experience on PitchPrint even better!

What's newðŸš€,

Design selector search update - In our latest release note, we introduced enhancements to the design selector search feature discussed in
our previous update. Now, users have the ability to search for designs using tags, design names, or even specific letters within a design
name. When you assign tags to a design in the inside the PitchPrint admin, these tags become searchable criteria. Furthermore, the search
function also allows you to find designs based on letters present within their design names. Below, we provide a few examples to illustrate
these capabilities:

Customer Design previews on Wordpress - Kindly take note that this particular feature is exclusively accessible for Wordpress with
Woocommerce. While we currently offer the ability to include a design file in an email, certain files may be excessively large to be easily
opened or attached to an email. As a solution, we have introduced an exceptional feature that enables the attachment of design previews
directly to the email on Wordpress. For further guidance on how to implement this functionality, please refer to the documentation available
here [https://docs.pitchprint.com/article/144-how-to-show-customer-design-previews-on-email-wordpress].

Default background mode option - Previously, we used a default method to showcase the background mode. However, we have now introduced an
exciting new feature that empowers the admin user to choose the default background mode when a new background is applied. This feature
offers three options: fill, fit and stretch. With this enhancement, admins have greater flexibility in determining how backgrounds are
displayed on the editor.

We also fixed the following bugs:

Duplicate projects in the orders page on WIX - We've resolved an issue that was causing duplicate projects to appear on the orders page for
all orders placed on products with variations enabled. With the fix in place, the orders page now displays the correct project(s) for each
order, eliminating any previous instances of duplicates.

That's it for this week folks, until next time have a lovely and productive week from the PitchPrint team!ðŸ˜Š
