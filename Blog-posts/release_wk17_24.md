Hi allðŸ‘‹,

We're back with our very first release note for this year, with plenty more to come! As always we love keeping you up to date with what our
team has been working on to make your experience even better!

What's newðŸš€,

Mini Mode on WIX - Our journey on WIX has seen significant progress since our initial integration on the platform, with ongoing
functionality enhancements to enrich the user experience. A notable recent feature addition is the support for Mini Mode, allowing users to
enjoy all three display modes seamlessly on WIX.

Cart Image functionality on WIX - We've also made significant enhancements to the way cart images function on WIX. By refining our code,
we've optimised the loading process, resulting in faster performance and smoother user experience. These refinements ensure that cart images
load efficiently and seamlessly integrate into the overall end user shopping experience on the platform.

We also made the following fixes:

Mini Mode Upload - We resolved an issue related to mini mode and uploads within clickable masks. Previously, if the shape deviated from a
square or rectangle, the functionality would unfortunately not work. With our fix, uploads now function seamlessly regardless of the shape,
ensuring compatibility with Mini display mode.

WIX Products - There was an issue on PitchPrint where products failed to display when an admin visited the products page
[https://admin.pitchprint.com/products]. Initially, products failed to show up upon the first load, necessitating a page reload for
visibility. However, we've addressed this issue, ensuring that products now appear promptly upon the initial page load.

Well that's it for this week's updates, stay tuned for more exciting features and fixes. Have a lovely week from the PitchPrint Team!ðŸ¤—
