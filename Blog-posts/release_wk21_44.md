Hi allðŸ‘‹,

It's always a pleasure to keep you up to date on what our team has been working on to make your experience with PitchPrint the best there
is.

What's newðŸš€,

Inline Display on Wix - We added inline display mode for Wix customers in addition to the full window display mode. We are working
diligently on adding the option of a mini display, this option will be available soon!

Order Completed Webhook on Wix - We added the order completed webhook on Wix. Previously, only two status options were showing, it was
either unpaid or paid unlike other frameworks that also have order completed, processing, on hold, cancelled failed, refunded etc. As per
our workflow, we normally use the order completed status of an order to fulfil a webhook but since this information isn't available on the
platform, we have opted for the order paid status as a trigger to fulfil the order completed webhook.

We also fixed the following:

Observables Module - We fixed an issue with the observables module, in the past our users would still have to select from the variants even
when sometimes there was only one variant available. We fixed this issue where the module will now detect if there's one variant available
and it will use this to choose a design and open the editor with that design.

> A few of our customers have experienced some issues with incorrect colors appearing in the PDF. PitchPrint uses CMYK values for the PDF
> File and RGB values for onscreen display and each color has an RGB and CMYK value section please refer Â to the image below, an incorrect
> CMYK value was provided or the field was left empty leading the PDF to be rendered using default color white. When creating a color please
> ensure that the color contains the correct RGB and CMYK value to avoid this issue.
