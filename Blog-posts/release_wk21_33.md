Hi allðŸ‘‹,

We hope that you are well and safe in these trying times, it's good to be back.

What's newðŸš€,

Double Click on Clickable mask - We've added a feature that allows your to double click on a mask with a photo inside, by double clicking on
the mask the customer will be able to move the mask.

Last week we fixed the following:

Issue with adding new colours - There was an issue when customers added new colours only a maximum of 3 colours would add, we've fixed this
issue customers can now add as many colours as they like.

Dimension issues with JPEG file download - There was an issue with designs that were created with the unit Pixels, the JPEG file had
different dimensions to the original design dimensions. We fixed this issue all files now have the correct dimensions as displayed in the
design.
