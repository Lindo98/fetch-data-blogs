Switch from 3D to 2D view - We've introduced an exciting feature that enables your customers to toggle between 2D and 3D views in the
preview area. Previously, customers were restricted to either a 2D or a 3D preview within the editor. This enhancement provides flexibility
for customers to switch between these views based on their preference and needs.

To enable this feature please go to layouts [https://admin.pitchprint.com/layouts] and reload latest. Then clear your cache on your product
page and you should be able to see the buttons as shown below:

> Please be sure to save your custom changes in an alternative location before reloading your layout.

Split by VFold lines - This awesome feature empowers you to split your PDF into separate pages utilising the VFold lines within PitchPrint.
Once enabled, the system will count the VFold lines and automatically segment your PDF into pages corresponding to the number of VFold lines
in the design. Please note that this feature is compatible with PDF distiller version 3. You can check your distiller version in the
settings [https://admin.pitchprint.com/settings] under the PDF section. To activate this valuable feature, follow these steps: open your
designs [https://admin.pitchprint.com/designs] in the designs section, navigate to the Page section, and add the split_by_vfoldlines tag as
shown below:
