Hi allðŸ‘‹,

We trust you are keeping well and safe in these trying times. We have quite a few surprises that we'll share with you in the first week of
July please keep your eyes peeled on our Social media pages for more exciting news.

What's newðŸš€

We've started posting tips and tricks on Facebook [https://www.facebook.com/pitchprint], Twitter [https://twitter.com/pitchprint] and
Instagram [https://www.instagram.com/pitchprint/] these tips and tricks will help new and existing users navigate their way around our
platform.

We've added a button to remove an image from the data form module, kindly reload your layout [https://admin.pitchprint.com/layouts] and
re-save your styling [https://admin.pitchprint.com/styling] for this option to display.

We've fixed the following issues:

Anchor Stroke and Fill Color - Anchor stroke and fill color did not update on the product page and we fixed the issue.

Page Loader Title - Page loader title did not update on the product page and we fixed this issue.
