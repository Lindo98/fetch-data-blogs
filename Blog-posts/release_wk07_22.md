Hi allðŸ‘‹,

It's always such an absolute pleasure for us to keep you up to date with what our team has been working on to make your experience at
PitchPrint even better!

What's newðŸš€,

Disable group selection - We added a feature which will allow the admin to enable/disable item group selection per design. Prior to this new
release, customers were able to select multiple items all at once but that resulted in items losing individual functionalities such as
selection lock, delete lock or transform lock just to name a few.

Now with this amazing feature the admin has more control and will be able to curb the issue of customers selecting multiple items at once
and subsequently having an adverse effect on individual item functionalities.

You can enable this feature by following these easy steps >> Going to designs [https://admin.pitchprint.com/designs] >> Click on the gear
icon >> Enable the toggle as shown below and Click save:

Category Customisation on OpenCart - We added the customisation button on all products within a category on OpenCart. Previously, customers
had to visit the product page to be able to access the designer. This awesome feature will enhance user experience and making the whole
process more efficient by allowing your customers to access the designer directly from the category page.

Retain Uploaded image dimensions - Prior to the deployment of this feature, when customers uploaded images, the image would scale down
immensely in the editor. This issue raised concerns as to whether the image still maintained its resolution and size within the editor.
We've now put those concerns at bay with this amazing feature which if enabled, it will allow the editor to retain the size and resolution
of the uploaded image irrespective of the file uploaded.

To enable this amazing feature go to https://admin.pitchprint.com/settings [https://admin.pitchprint.com/settings] >> Scroll down to File
Uploads and enable the toggle switch below, please be sure to save any changes you make.
