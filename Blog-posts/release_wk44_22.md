# **Blog Title**: Release WK44-22

**Blog URL**: [https://blog.pitchprint.com/release-wk44-22](https://blog.pitchprint.com/release-wk44-22)Hi allüëã,

It's always a pleasure for us to keep you updated with what our team has been working on to making your experience on PitchPrint even
better.

What's newüöÄ,

ProjectId in PitchPrint Admin - In an effort to continue with the Ease of Use initiative that our plugin is known for, we've added another
useful column to the projects tab which displays the ProjectId making it easier for admins to manoeuvre our platform and find ProjectId with
ease. Please refer to the image below:

Admins will now be able to easily identify a project and also have easy access to the unique Id associated with that respective project.

Automatically Zoom Canvas - We've also added this great new feature which empowers the admins to be able to zoom the canvas automatically
with just a few tweaks in the layout section. This feature will aid customers with design templates specifically with small mask areas such
as pens, pencils, or any other design with a small canvas area so that the end user can focus on what is key when customizing a product, the
design area. Please refer to the instructions below on how to enable this feature:

Go to layouts [https://admin.pitchprint.com/layouts]. Add a new layout give the layout a title and then click submit.

Once you've created the new layout add the following code inside the script tag in your layout: window._zoomRegion = true; Please refer to
