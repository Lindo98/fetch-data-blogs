Hi allðŸ‘‹,

It's always such an absolute pleasure for us to inform you about what our team has been working on to make your experience with PitchPrint
even better.

What's new ðŸš€

Added Fold Lines to PDF - We added the Vertical and Horizontal fold lines to the PDF file. This will aid in making sure that the printer
knows exactly where to cut the files.

3D Previews on WIX - The 3D feature is now finally available on WIX. When a customer submits their design, the 3D model will now appear in
the place of the product page image.

Now onto our weekly bug fixes:

Customisation form - Some of our customers had an issue with the customisation form not auto populating the canvas with the recently
uploaded images. We have now fixed this issue, when a customer uploads images into the customisation form it will override the previous
images on the canvas with the new ones. Have a look at the image below for reference:
