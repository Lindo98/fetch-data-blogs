 * DPI Check with notification warning - This warning only appears once to prevent spaming and only shows after 10 seconds of interaction.
   We will implement an additional warning to the preview page just before submission.
 * Text inputs are stripped of emoticons - Emojis do not render consistently on PDFs so we are removing them. Even on our devices, emojis
   look different between devices.
 * Retain Design Page in Admin - After saving a design in admin, the whole page is no longer reloaded. The new design is simply appended to
   the category list
 * Google Font import - Importing fonts in the app is more streamlined. Closing the font import panel opens the font popup and displays the
   newly imported fonts top of the list
 * New Page Color Fix - When adding a new page in designer, the color defaults to white instead of black.
