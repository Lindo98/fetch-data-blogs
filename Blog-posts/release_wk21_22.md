# **Blog Title**: Release WK21-22

Hi allðŸ‘‹,

We trust that you are well and had a relaxing weekend and keeping safe during these trying timesðŸ™‚.

Last week we worked on the following:

Context menu buttons on mobile - When cropping an image on mobile, the context menu buttons weren't present. We fixed this issue. Please
re-save your styling [https://admin.pitchprint.com/styling] for this to work.

Display thumbnail in form - The upload image indicator was not present inside the data form module or inside the form until after a customer
uploaded an image. We added a default image upload indicator.

Search by Date - We added the ability to search by date using a calendar in the universal search console on our new Admin Panel
[https://admin.pitchprint.com/dashboard].


NEW DESIGN SELECTIONS

Additionally we've updated our import design library, we now have 28 categories to choose from and plenty of new designs added to existing
